Building a stock market prediction model from scratch requires a deep understanding of machine learning concepts, implementation of algorithms, and thorough data processing. Here’s a detailed play-by-play guide to help you:

---

### **Phase 1: Problem Formulation**
1. **Define the Objective**:
   - Predict future stock prices (regression).
   - Predict price movement direction (classification).

2. **Understand the Dataset**:
   - Identify key features like `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`.
   - Include derived features like moving averages, volatility, and momentum.

3. **Determine Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term (e.g., next day’s price).
   - Long-term (e.g., next month’s trend).

---

### **Phase 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Use APIs like Yahoo Finance (`yfinance` in Python), Alpha Vantage, or Quandl.
   - Collect historical data for multiple stocks if desired.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Handle Missing Data**: Use interpolation or forward-fill methods.
   - **Scale Features**: Normalize data using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standard scaling.
   - **Create Derived Features**:
     - **Lag Features**: Previous days' prices.
     - **Rolling Features**: Moving averages, rolling standard deviation.
     - **Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands.

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Use a time-based split for training and testing (e.g., 80% past data for training, 20% recent data for testing).

### **Phase 3: Model Design (Core ML Concepts)**

To build the model from scratch, you’ll implement key ML algorithms. Here’s a progression:

#### **1. Linear Regression (Baseline Model)**
   - Predict future stock prices based on weighted sum of features.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Compute weights \( w \) using the formula:  
       \[
       w = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
       \]
     - Use the weights to predict future values \( y' = X w \).

---

#### **2. Gradient Descent (Core Optimization Concept)**
   - Implement gradient descent to optimize regression weights.
   - Update rule:
     \[
     w = w - \alpha \cdot \nabla J(w)
     \]
   - Implement cost function \( J(w) \) (e.g., Mean Squared Error).

---

#### **3. Regularization (Lasso/Ridge)**
   - Add regularization to avoid overfitting:
     - Lasso: \( J(w) + \lambda ||w||_1 \)
     - Ridge: \( J(w) + \lambda ||w||_2^2 \)

---

#### **4. Time-Series Models (Autoregressive Concepts)**
   - Predict future values based on past values:
     \[
     y(t) = \phi_1 y(t-1) + \phi_2 y(t-2) + \ldots + \epsilon
     \]

---

#### **5. Neural Networks (Advanced ML Concept)**
   - Build a custom feedforward neural network for time-series data.
   - Use backpropagation to update weights.


---

### **Phase 4: Evaluation**
1. **Regression Metrics**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

2. **Classification Metrics**:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

3. **Plot Predictions**:
   - Compare predicted vs. actual prices.

---

### **Phase 5: Optimization**
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Adjust learning rate, epochs, regularization factors.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Test feature importance and drop irrelevant ones.

3. **Model Validation**:
   - Use cross-validation with time-series split.

---

### **Phase 6: Deployment**
1. **Save Model**:
   - Serialize weights and biases for deployment.

2. **Integrate into Application**:
   - Use your preferred programming language (Python, C++) to run predictions on real-time data.
